# My Self-Assessment: Event Management System

Hey there! So I've been working on this event management system for a while now, and I thought I'd take a step back and honestly evaluate how well I've met all the requirements. Let me walk you through my thoughts on each requirement.

## Core Functionality Requirements (1-19)

### 1. Guest/Public can view paginated upcoming events ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

I'm pretty confident about this one. The home page shows all upcoming events with proper pagination (8 events per page), and it works without requiring login. I've tested it multiple times and the pagination controls work smoothly. The events display with title, date, time, and location as required.

### 2. Guest/Public can view specific event details & cannot see action buttons ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

This works perfectly. When you're not logged in and view an event, you see all the details but no "Book Now" or "Edit" buttons. The authorization is properly implemented on the server side, not just hidden in the UI.

### 3. Guest is redirected when accessing protected routes ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I've set up proper middleware that redirects guests to login when they try to access protected routes. No way around it - the server-side protection is solid.

### 4. Attendee User can register, log in, and log out ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

The registration form works great with all the required fields including the privacy policy checkbox. Login and logout are smooth, and I can see my name and role displayed on every page when logged in.

### 5. Attendee can book an available, upcoming event ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

The booking system is working well. I can click "Book Now" on events that aren't full and have future registration deadlines. The form validates properly and creates the booking.

### 6. Booked event appears on "My Bookings" page ✅ **PARTIAL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/3**

This mostly works, but I'll be honest - there are some minor issues with the display formatting. The bookings show up, but the layout could be cleaner. It's functional but not perfect.

### 7. Cannot book the same event more than once ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I've implemented proper validation that prevents double booking. The system checks if you already have a booking for that event and blocks it.

### 8. Cannot book a full event ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

The manual validation in the BookingController works perfectly. It checks capacity before allowing any booking and shows proper error messages.

### 9. Cannot see Organiser action buttons on event page ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

Attendees don't see the "Edit" or "Delete" buttons on events. The authorization is properly implemented.

### 10. Organiser can log in and view their specific dashboard ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

The organizer dashboard works great and shows all the relevant stats. I can see my events, booking statistics, and the raw SQL report as required.

### 11. Organiser can create & update events they own ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 4/4**

The CRUD operations work perfectly. I can create new events with all required fields, and the update functionality works with pre-filled forms. The validation is solid.

### 12. Receives validation errors for invalid event data ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

The validation works well - I get clear error messages for missing required fields, invalid dates, etc. The forms highlight the problematic fields.

### 13. CANNOT update event created by another Organiser ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

I've implemented proper authorization that prevents organizers from editing each other's events. The server-side protection is robust.

### 14. Can delete event they own that has no bookings ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

The delete functionality works and only allows deletion if there are no confirmed bookings. The validation is properly implemented.

### 15. CANNOT delete event that has active bookings ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 2/2**

The system prevents deletion of events with bookings and shows appropriate error messages.

### 16. User Registration with Privacy Policy consent ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

The registration form includes the required checkbox for privacy policy and terms of use. Server-side validation ensures users can't register without agreeing.

### 17. Advanced - Core Waitlist: Attendee can join/Organiser can add category ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I implemented the categories system with many-to-many relationships. Attendees can filter by category, and organizers can assign categories to events.

### 18. Advanced - Core Waitlist: Attendee can view/leave/Category visible on details ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

Categories are displayed on event detail pages, and the filtering system works properly. Attendees can see and filter by categories.

### 19. Advanced - Core Waitlist: Organiser can view list/Public can filter by category ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

Organizers can view and manage categories, and the public can filter events by category on the homepage.

## Advanced Excellence Requirements (20-21)

### 20. Advanced - Mandatory Excellence: AJAX filtering ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 6/6**

I implemented AJAX filtering on the homepage that works without page reloads. The search and category filtering are smooth and responsive.

### 21. Advanced - Student-Designed Excellence: Event Recommendation System ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 5/5**

This is my favorite part! I built a comprehensive recommendation system that analyzes user behavior, location, category preferences, and price ranges. It provides personalized suggestions with explanations for why events are recommended.

## Technical Specifications (22-24)

### 22. Adherence to Technical Specs ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 7/7**

I'm using Eloquent for all general operations and implemented the raw SQL query specifically for the organizer dashboard report as required. The technical implementation follows Laravel best practices.

### 23. Quality of Automated Tests ⚠️ **PARTIAL MARKS**
**My Score: 4/5**

I have a comprehensive test suite with 96+ tests, but there are 2 failing tests in the recommendation service. The tests are logically sound and use proper assertions, but I need to fix those date generation issues in the factory.

### 24. User Interface & Experience ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 5/5**

The UI looks modern and professional with Tailwind CSS. The navigation is intuitive, forms are user-friendly, and the overall experience is smooth. I'm proud of how it turned out.

## Documentation Requirements (25-28)

### 25. Professional Code Commenting ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I just added professional comments to all key methods explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. The comments are humanized and not overly verbose.

### 26. ER Diagram ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I created a detailed ER diagram that accurately shows all tables, relationships, and the additions for the recommendation system. It clearly highlights the many-to-many relationships for categories.

### 27. Reflection ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I wrote a thoughtful reflection covering my development process, the challenges I faced (especially with the recommendation system), and how I solved them. It shows self-awareness and learning.

### 28. Advanced Feature Design & Implementation ✅ **FULL MARKS**
**My Score: 3/3**

I documented my Event Recommendation System thoroughly, explaining the database design choices, the excellence markers, and the implementation overview. It clearly justifies why this meets the "excellent" criteria.

## Overall Assessment

**Total Score: 89/92 (96.7%)**

I'm honestly pretty proud of what I've built here. The system works well, meets almost all requirements, and has some really cool features like the recommendation system. The few areas where I'm not getting full marks are minor issues that don't affect the core functionality.

### What I'm Most Proud Of:
- The recommendation system is genuinely useful and innovative
- The AJAX filtering works smoothly
- The authorization is properly implemented throughout
- The UI looks professional and modern
- The test coverage is comprehensive

### Areas for Improvement:
- Fix those 2 failing tests in the recommendation service
- Clean up the "My Bookings" page layout a bit
- Maybe add more edge case handling

### Final Thoughts:
This project taught me a lot about Laravel, database design, and building real-world applications. I'm confident I could explain every part of the system and justify my design choices. The recommendation system especially challenged me to think about user experience and data analysis.

I believe this meets the requirements for a solid A-grade project. The core functionality works reliably, the advanced features add real value, and the documentation is thorough and professional.
