AI Policy Stuff
I know I have to be the one who built this app and I need to be able to explain everything during the demo. I'm responsible for knowing how all my code works and why I made the decisions I did.

What AI Actually Made (The Allowed Stuff)
1. Test Suite - AI helped me write the test cases
2. Privacy Policy and Terms of Use - AI wrote the legal stuff

How AI Helped Me (But I Did All The Real Work)

Documentation Help
AI helped me organize my documentation and make it sound better. But all the technical stuff about how my system works, my database design, and my recommendation algorithm is my own work and understanding.

Debugging Help
AI helped me find and fix bugs like login problems, booking issues, route errors, and date formatting stuff. But I wrote and fixed all the actual code and I understand what I changed.

Learning Stuff
AI explained Laravel features, database relationships, and AJAX to me. These explanations helped me learn, but all the actual code I wrote is mine.

Project Ideas
AI gave me suggestions about how to organize files and name things. But I made all the final decisions about how to build everything.

What I Can Explain
I can talk about all the important parts of my app:

Database Design - Why I used many-to-many for categories and how my tables connect
Recommendation Algorithm - How I calculate scores, what data I use, how I handle new users
Authentication - How login works, what each user role can do, how access is restricted
Booking System - How I handle event capacity, stop duplicate bookings, my validation rules
AJAX Features - How filtering and recommendations load without page reloads
Service Architecture - Why I put recommendation logic in its own class and how it connects to controllers
Security - My validation strategies, how I protect user data, role permissions

What I Built Myself
I wrote all the main logic including:
Event creation, editing, and deletion
Booking system with capacity and validation
Authentication and user role management
My custom recommendation algorithm
Category and event relationship management
Database migrations and schema design
Controllers, models, and all business logic
Frontend JavaScript for AJAX features

I'm responsible for all the code I submitted and I can walk through any part during the demo.

About AI Help
AI was just a learning and support tool for me, not something that wrote my code. I used it to understand concepts better, fix bugs, and improve documentation. But I didn't use it to write the core of my project.

Everything important in this system is my own work and I'm ready to explain it all during the final presentation.
